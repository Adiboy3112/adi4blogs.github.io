          TIL 01/45 Summary (Last 45 days)#Last 45 days have been a roller coaster ride for me. I saw some steep falls, some momentary peaks and had some very helpful realizations. After Semester 4, I had a pretty hard time coping up with the shortcomings and results of the semester,I lost my confidence and felt insecure about my career (I still feel that ;_;). Through all this time I felt helpless and drifted away from people.

          I really don&amp;rsquo;t know!#Yo! So this is it, finally I am starting to write this blog. I have been planning to write this blog since last weekend but mehhhh, I am lazy. So since last one week I have been bombed with a specific genre of questions by my well wishers:
&amp;ldquo;What next? What do I plan to do next? What profile have I shortlisted for the upcoming campus internship drive?

          Hello Readers, Welcome to Adiboy&amp;rsquo;s Blogs!#Why am I starting to write blogs?#I always wanted to write blogs. On many nights when i go to sleep, I feel like sharing about my day with someone or maybe write a diary entry or sometimes share good memories on social media, but I dont feel comfortable doing any of that. So yeah, I guess Blogs will work.
What to expect from my blogs?
